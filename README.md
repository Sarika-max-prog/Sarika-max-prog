# 👩‍💻 Hey, I'm Sarika!

🎓 I'm an MCA graduate with a deep passion for **data analysis, visualization**, and **machine learning**.  
📊 I believe in the power of data to tell stories, solve problems, and drive smart decisions.  
🔍 I'm currently exploring real-world projects using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, and building hands-on skills in **machine learning** and **web scraping**.

I enjoy turning messy data into clear insights — whether it's a dashboard, a predictive model, or a fun scraping tool!
