## 🚀 Projects

### 📘 **Insights into Book Popularity & Reviews**
Built an end-to-end interactive dashboard to analyze Goodreads book data. Cleaned and processed 10,000+ records using Python, stored data in MySQL, and created performance-optimized dashboards in Power BI. Key insights included top-rated books, author analysis, genre trends, and rating patterns over the years to help users discover popular and high-rated books effectively.

#### ✅ Features
- Interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers for author, publisher, and language
- Visuals for top-rated books, popular authors, and rating trends over time
- Genre and language-based insights for deeper analysis
- Hierarchical filter combining author and publisher
- End-to-end project using Python, SQL, and Power BI

#### 🛠️ Tech & Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL (MySQL Workbench), Power BI

### 🌤️ **Weather Prediction**
Developed a supervised machine learning model to predict weather conditions (e.g., Rainy, Sunny, Cloudy) using historical weather data. The project aimed to assist in planning and decision-making by providing accurate short-term forecasts.

#### ✅ Features
- Collected and cleaned real-world weather data from Kaggle
- Performed feature engineering (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)
- Used classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Automated daily predictions using a scheduler
- Visualized results on an interactive dashboard (Power BI / Streamlit)

#### 🛠️ Tech & Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit / Power BI
